# VisualDataStructure

## Overview
**VisualDataStructure** is an interactive web-based tool for visualizing data structures and algorithms. This project was created entirely by **SRINIVAS DM** to help learners understand how different data structures operate dynamically.

## Features
The application supports visualization of the following data structures:
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Doubly Linked List
- Double-Ended Queue 

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the front-end
- **jQuery & D3.js** for dynamic animations
- **Custom-built JavaScript modules** for data structure manipulation

## Usage
1. Open `list.html` in a web browser.
3. Select a data structure from the navigation menu.
4. Perform operations such as **Create, Insert, Search, Remove**, and see them animated in real-time.

## Why I Built This
Understanding data structures can be difficult without visual aid. This tool was developed to bridge that gap by offering clear, animated explanations for each operation.
